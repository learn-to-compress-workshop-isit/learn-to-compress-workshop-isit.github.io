We invite researchers from data compression and related fields to submit their latest work on theory and applications of data compression to the workshop. All accepted papers will be presented as posters during the poster session. Some papers will also be selected for **spotlight presentations**.

Topics of interest include but are not limited to:
* Source coding (e.g., images, video, abstract sources) in the era of machine learning.
* Learning-based approaches to information theory.
* Theoretical foundations of learned compression.
* Quantization, entropy coding, stochastic coding, and channel synthesis.
* Compression under perceptual/realism metrics.
* Learning-based approaches to distributed and multi-terminal compression.


## Important Dates
* Paper submission deadline: March 3, 2024 (11:59 PM, anywhere in the world!).
* Decision notification: April 15, 2024.
* Camera-ready paper deadline: May 6, 2024.
* ISIT early registration deadline: May 6, 2024.
* Workshop date: July 7, 2024.

## Submission Details

The authors can submit either an extended abstract (up to 3 pages) or a full-paper (up to 5 pages of main text, one optional page containing only references, and an optional 5-page appendix for
further details, proofs etc.). All submissions should be prepared in the ISIT paper format. You can find information for authors such as paper format, template and example in this [link](https://2024.ieee-isit.org/information-authors-0). All submissions (papers and extended abstracts) should be made through our venue home page on [OpenReview](https://openreview.net/group?id=IEEE.org/ISIT/2024/Workshop/LCW#tab-your-consoles). 


Each paper will go through a rigorous review process. The workshop will follow a **single-blind reviewing policy**, aligned with the ISIT 2024, which means that the all submitted manuscripts should include author names and affiliations. The authors can post their papers on arXiv if they wish to do so. 

For full-paper submissions, we will offer authors the choice to publish their accepted papers on IEEE Xplore. All accepted submissions (extended abstract or full-paper) will also be published via OpenReview after the workshop. 

We welcome all relevant submissions that have been presented, published or are currently undergoing review elsewhere, *if the authors decide not to publish their full-paper on IEEE Xplore*.

An author of an accepted paper or extended abstract must register to the workshop and present a poster. For some selected papers, there will be a spotlight presentation (see [Schedule](https://learn-to-compress-workshop-isit.github.io/schedule/)). To maintain the interactive nature of the workshop, we kindly request all presentations to be **in-person**.  

Only accepted papers that are presented will be published on IEEE Xplore. The requirements of the poster will be communicated with the acceptance notification for the paper.
