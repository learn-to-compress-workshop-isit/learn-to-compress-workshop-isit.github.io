## Topics

We invite researchers from data compression and related fields to submit their latest work on theory and applications of data compression to the workshop. Topics of interest include but are not limited to:
* Source coding (e.g., images, video, abstract sources) in the era of machine learning.
* Learning-based approaches to information theory.
* Theoretical foundations of learned compression.
* Quantization, entropy coding, stochastic coding, and channel synthesis.
* Compression under perceptual/realism metrics.
* Learning-based approaches to distributed and multi-terminal compression.


## Important Dates
* Paper submission: March 3, 2024 (11:59 PM, anywhere in the world!).
* Decision notification: April 5, 2024.
* Workshop date: July 7, 2024.

## Submission Details

The authors can submit either an extended abstract (up to 2 pages) or a full-paper (up to 5 pages of main text). All submissions should be prepared in the ISIT paper format. Accepted extended abstracts will be presented **in-person** as posters during the workshop.

All full-papers must be formatted as per the requirements of a standard ISIT paper (i.e., up to 5 pages of main text, one optional page containing only references, and an optional 5-page appendix for further details, proofs etc.). You can find the information for authors such as paper format, template and example in this [link](https://2024.ieee-isit.org/information-authors-0).

Each paper will go through a rigorous review process. An author of an accepted paper (or extended abstract) must register to the workshop and will either present a poster and/or give a spotlight presentation (see [Schedule](https://learn-to-compress-workshop-isit.github.io/schedule/)) based on the paper at the workshop. To maintain the interactive nature of the workshop, we kindly request all presentations to be **in-person**.  

We will offer authors the choice to publish their papers on IEEE Xplore, if they wish to do so. Only the accepted papers that are presented (as posters and/or spotlight presentations) will be published on IEEE Xplore. The requirements of the poster will be communicated with the acceptance notification for the paper. 

All submissions (papers and extended abstracts) should be made through our venue home page on [OpenReview](https://openreview.net/group?id=IEEE.org/ISIT/2024/Workshop/LCW#tab-your-consoles). All papers will also be published via OpenReview after the workshop. 

The workshop will follow a **soft double-blind reviewing policy**, which means that the authors are required to make sure that their submitted paper (or extended abstract) does not reveal the identity of the author. However, we do not forbid the publication of the work on arXiv.
