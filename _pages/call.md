## Topics

We invite researchers from data compression and related fields to submit their latest work on theory and applications of data compression to the workshop. Topics of interest include but are not limited to:
* Source coding (e.g., images, video, abstract sources) in the era of machine learning.
* Learning-based approaches to information theory.
* Theoretical foundations of learned compression.
* Quantization, entropy coding, stochastic coding, and channel synthesis.
* Compression under perceptual/realism metrics.
* Learning-based approaches to distributed and multi-terminal compression.


## Important Dates
We will release details shortly.
