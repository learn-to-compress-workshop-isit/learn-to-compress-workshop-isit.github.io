<!-- #### Invited Talk 1: *Toward rate-distortion-perception optimality with lattice transform coding*
<a name="shirin" class="speaker"></a>

**Speaker:** [Prof. Shirin Saeedi Bidokhti](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~saeedi)

**Abstract**

Data-driven methods have been the driving force of many
scientific disciplines in the past decade, relying on huge amounts of
empirical, experimental, and scientific data. Working with big data is
impossible without data compression techniques that reduce the
dimension and size of the data for storage and communication purposes
and effectively denoise for efficient and accurate processing. In the
past decade, learning-based compressors such as nonlinear transform
coding (NTC) have shown great success in the task of compression by
learning to map a high dimensional source onto its representative
latent space of lower dimension using neural networks  and compressing
in that latent space.  However, despite their empirical success, NTC
and its variants are not optimal. To address this, we incorporate
fundamental principles from information theory into the design of
practical, learning-based compression methods. In particular, we
propose lattice transform coding, a principled framework that achieves
optimal rate-distortion and rate-distortion–perception tradeoffs for
Gaussian sources and demonstrates improvements over existing methods
on real-world datasets.

#### Invited Talk 2: *New directions in causal inference via de Finetti theorems and algorithmic information theory*
<a name="ferenc" class="speaker"></a>

**Speaker:** [Prof. Ferenc Huszár](https://www.inference.vc/about/)

**Abstract**

This talk will challenge well known results about the non-identifiably of causal relationships from observational data. Firstly, I will present how, by relaxing the common assumption that data is obtained i.i.d., one can perform causal identification using the so called causal de Finetti theorems. Then, pointing out the limitations of this approach, I will discuss how algorithmic information theory, and new notions such as algorithmic exchangeability may unlock new possibilities for analysing causal structures.

#### Invited Talk 3: *Picking the right few: a statistical theory of data selection under weak supervision*
<a name="pulkit" class="speaker"></a>

**Speaker:** [Dr. Pulkit Tandon](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pulkit-tandon-8621a3a8/)

**Abstract**

Labeling and training costs now rival raw-data storage in modern learning pipelines. I will present a principled view of data selection as a complementary form of compression — one that trims the learning budget (labels, interactions, compute) rather than the bitrate. Given a vast unlabeled pool and a weak surrogate model that predicts better than chance, we ask: which n out of N points should we annotate to minimize test error? Through asymptotic analysis and experiments on toy and real-world image datasets, we derive closed-form performance curves and pinpoint regimes where biased selection outperforms popular unbiased heuristics such as influence-function-based sampling. We also uncover the counterintuitive finding that discarding large portions of data, or steering selection with a very weak surrogate, can actually boost generalization even in simple settings. I will close the talk by sketching how the same framework extends to recommender systems and other resource-constrained learning problems.

#### Invited Talk 4: *Transformers learn to compress variable-order Markov chain sources in context*
<a name="chao" class="speaker"></a>

**Speaker:** [Prof. Chao Tian](https://tiangroup.engr.tamu.edu/)
 
**Abstract**

We study in-context learning of variable-length Markov chains by viewing language modeling as a form of data compression and focusing on the well-known variable-order Markov chain (VOMC) sources. This perspective allows classical compression algorithms, particularly the Bayesian optimal context-tree weighting (CTW) algorithm, to serve as baselines. We observe that single-layer transformers cannot learn VOMC in context, while transformers with two or more layers can indeed do so, with more layers providing small but noticeable improvements. Moreover, attention-only networks appear insufficient for this task. We analyze the attention map to extract meaningful structures and provide transformer constructions to explain the observed phenomena. A transformer construction with $D+2$ layers is given that can perform CTW accurately for VOMCs of maximum order $D$, and a simplified transformer construction utilizing partial information for approximate blending is studied to explain why 2-layer transformers work well.

#### Invited Talk 5: *State of Learned Compression: Past, Present & Future*
<a name="kedar" class="speaker"></a>

**Speaker:** [Dr. Kedar Tatwawadi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RU0ZAp4AAAAJ&hl=en)

**Abstract**

In the past decade, ML based methods have introduced a powerful new paradigm for both lossless and lossy data compression. These learned approaches have enabled flexible, data-driven alternatives to traditional hand-crafted codecs, often matching or exceeding their performance in specific domains. In this talk, I will highlight a selection of landmark works in learned compression that have proven influential and enduring, setting foundational ideas that continue to shape the field. I will also present a few notable success stories where learned compression techniques have been deployed in real-world systems, shedding light on what made these deployments possible. Finally, I will discuss key challenges ahead as we reflect on what’s needed for learned compression to become a widely adopted part of future data infrastructure.

#### Invited Talk 6: *Recent Advances in Diffusion-Based Generative Compression* 
<a name="yibo" class="speaker"></a>

**Speaker:** [Dr. Yibo Yang](https://yiboyang.com/about/)

**Abstract**

Popularized by their strong image generation performance, diffusion and related methods for mass transport ("diffusion" for short) have found widespread success in visual media applications.  In particular, diffusion methods have enabled new approaches to generative data compression, where realistic reconstructions can be achieved at extremely low bitrates.  In this talk, we will review recent diffusion-based methods for lossy compression, focusing on image compression with high realism. These methods generally employ diffusion in the decoding procedure to iteratively refine a compact data representation, such that the final reconstruction approximately follows the ground truth data distribution. The data representation can take on various forms and is typically transmitted via an auxiliary entropy model, with recent work exploring the use of diffusion models themselves for information transmission. We will discuss connections to inverse problem solving, rate-distortion-realism theory, architecture choices, and open research questions.
