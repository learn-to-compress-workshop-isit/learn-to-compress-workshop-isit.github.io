### **Keynotes**:

**Speaker**: [Dr. Johannes Ballé](https://balle.io/). 

**Title**: Learned Image Compression. 

**Abstract**: Since its emergence roughly 7 years ago, the field of learned data compression has attracted considerable attention from both the machine learning and information theory communities. Data-driven source coding promises faster innovation cycles, as well as better adaptation to novel types of sources and unconventional models of distortion. For example, image codecs can now be end-to-end optimized to perform best for specific types of images, by simply replacing the training set. They may now be designed to minimize a given perceptual image metric, or in fact any differentiable perceptual loss function. In this talk, I will review nonlinear transform coding (NTC), a framework of techniques which over the past few years have superseded the state of the art of hand-crafted image compression methods (such as the family of JPEG and MPEG standards) in terms of subjective quality vs. rate. I’ll illustrate the empirical rate–distortion performance of NTC with the help of simple, analytically characterized data sources. Furthermore, I will discuss a recent direction of ongoing work, the search for better measures of perceptual quality, as captured by realism (“How realistic is an image?”) and fidelity (“How similar is an image to a reference?”). I present Wasserstein Distortion, a measure to unify the two, grounded in neuroscientific models of peripheral vision.

**Title**: Accelerating Relative Entropy Coding with Space Partitioning.

**Abstract**: Relative entropy coding (REC) algorithms aim to transmit a random sample following distribution Q, using a prior distribution P shared between the sender and receiver. General REC algorithms suffer from prohibitive runtimes and existing fast REC algorithms have been limited to very specific problem settings. In this talk, I will introduce a new REC method that utilizes space partitioning to potentially reduce runtime in more practical scenarios than previous scalable REC algorithms. We provide theoretical results for our proposed method and demonstrate its efficiency through both toy examples and practical applications in neural compression. While our approach does not achieve polynomial time complexity, it enables handling larger REC problems much more efficiently. This results in not only faster REC encoding processes but also reduced codelength overhead, thereby offering performance improvements in neural compression applications.

**Speaker**: [Dr. Lucas Theis](https://theis.io/).

**Title**: Lossy Compression with Diffusion.

**Abstract**: This talk explores new methods for lossy image compression based on diffusion and channel simulation. By simulating a Gaussian channel, any diffusion generative model can be appropriated for compression. The resulting approach is notably different from the transform coding approach that underpins modern codecs and almost all neural compression approaches. However, we find that it works surprisingly well despite the lack of an analysis transform and despite its conceptual simplicity. We further find that this simplicity makes it very amenable to theoretical analysis and offer initial results on its rate-distortion performance under realism constraints.

**Title**: Compression Codes: Bridging Theory and Algorithms in Signal Processing and Learning.

**Abstract**: In the realm of signal processing and machine learning, a foundational challenge lies in developing robust theoretical frameworks that guide the analysis and design of effective solutions. This talk explores the power of compression codes as a unifying framework for these tasks. By leveraging the principles of data compression, we can derive insightful theoretical perspectives that enhance our understanding of inference and learning problems. This framework not only provides a novel lens for theoretical analysis but also informs the creation of practically sound and theoretically-grounded algorithms. We will examine how compression codes bridge this gap, paving the way for advancements in signal processing and machine learning research.
