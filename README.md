Please refer to the [this workshop repo](https://github.com/diffusionworkshop/diffusionworkshop.github.io) and the original Jekyll theme it is based on, [al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio), to see similar design ideas. 

# Updating for following years:
 - copy last year's folder in `_pages` and update year
 - set `nav: true` for previous years' `dropdown.md`, and set `nav:false` for all other files
 - copy last year's `workshop_xxxx.html` in `layouts` and change appropriately
